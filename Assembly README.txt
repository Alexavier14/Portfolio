To run the game, you will need to create following folder:
-Assets

Within Asset Folder are 5 seperate folders:

-Animations
-Mesh
-SoundBanks
-Textures
-XML


Place all named zip files into their respective folders. Place
all files from Textures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 into one folder. Place
Soundbanks 1 and 2 into one folder

The .sdf file was omitted due to space issues. All source code
